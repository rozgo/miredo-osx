.TH "ISATAPD" "8" "$Date: 2006-12-15 09:17:05 -0700 (Fri, 15 Dec 2006) $" "isatapd" "System Manager's Manual"
.SH NAME
isatapd \- userland ISATAP pseudo-tunnel daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "isatapd" " [" "-c config_file" "] [" "-f" "] [" "-u user" "] ["
.BR "-t chrootdir" "] [" "router IPv4 address" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTON
.B ISATAPd
is a daemon program providing an ISATAP pseudo-tunnel interface in
userland, compatible with the "Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
Protocol" Internet experimental protocol (RFC\ 4214).

This is mostly useful to provide IPv6 connectivity to dual-stack nodes
on a IPv4 network.

If used as a ISATAP router, you will also most likely want to run radvd
on the tunnel interface, to provide autoconf services to other nodes.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR "\-c config_file" " or " "\-\-config config_file"
Specify an alternate configuration file for ISATAPd instead of the
.RI "default, " "@sysconfdir@/isatapd.conf" "."

.TP
.BR "\-f" " or " "\-\-foreground"
Do not detach from the console. Run the program in the foreground.

.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Display some help and exit.

.TP
.BR "\-t" " or " "\-\-chrootdir"
Specify a directory to use as a root after initialization is completed.
When used as a Teredo client, the hostname resolver library files must
be present in the chroot. The directory can safely be left empty for a
Teredo relay.

.TP
.BR "\-u username" " or " "\-\-user username"
Override the user that the program will run as. By default, it runs as
.BR "nobody" "."

.TP
.BR "\-V" " or " "\-\-version"
Display program version and license and exit.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
The ISATAP router sends duplicated packets or none at all.
If there is another IPv6-over-IPv4 (pseudo)tunnel running on the same
.RB "router, make sure it is bound " "explicitly" " to another IPv4"
address. In particular, you cannot use the sit0 tunnel device on Linux
while running isatapd, since you cannot bind sit0 to a specific IPv4
address.

.TP
Dead loop on virtual device XXX, fix it urgently!
Your routing table is probably incomplete or stalled.
Keep in mind you must always configure network interfaces explicitly
on IPv6 routers, including the ISATAP virtual interface.

.TP
Router advertisements are not sent to clients.
ISATAP does not support multicast.
You must configure the Router Advertisement daemon to send
.B unicast
advertisements only. With radvd, this is done by specifying
'UnicastOnly on' in the ISATAP interface section.

.TP
ISATAP clients loose their autoconfigured addresses after a while.
Linux (and possibly other IPv6 stacks) only try autoconfiguration when
the network interface link state changes.
For isatapd, that means only at startup.
Therefore, you must ensure that the Router Advertisements specify
lifetimes that are longer than the longest possible continuous uptime
of isatapd on any ISATAP client.
If this is not feasible, do not use autoconfiguration,
do not use isatapd, or force manual periodic router solicitations
with rdisc6 (from the ndisc6 package).

.SH BUGS
It would not be very complicated to implement support for ISATAP within
the existing IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel framework that exists in the Linux
and BSD kernels. This has even been implemented before, but these
implementation never entered the official kernels, and eventually got
withdrawn, because of a patent claim. In the mean time, the patent's
holder has defined its policy as
.IR "No License Required for Implementers" ", "
so we will hopefully see in-kernel implementations back soon.

ISATAPd only provide limited support for ISATAP client at the moment.
Only one router can be used (Potential Routers List is not properly
implemented).

Also, because of a limitation in the tunnel driver interface provided
by the Linux and BSD IPv6 stacks,
some packets may be unduely sent to the ISATAP router
instead of another client on same ISATAP virtual network segment.
That being noted, it would be much worse if you used a plain
point-to-point tunnel to connect to an ISATAP network.
More generally, gateway addresses in the routing table are ignored.

.SH SECURITY
.B ISATAPd
requires
.I root
privileges to create its IPv6 tunneling network interface, to set
it up properly, and also to open a raw IPv6-over-IPv4 socket. Once its
initialization is complete, it will
.IR "setgid" ", " "chroot" " into an empty directory and ultimately"
.IR "setuid" " (see option " "-u" "), so as to decrease the system's"
exposure to potential security issues.

.B Extreme care
must be taken to ensure that ISATAP packets cannot cross the network
edge. Otherwise, it might be possible for IPv4 outsiders to pretend to
be part of the local IPv6 network segment. Blocking incoming and
outgoing IPv6-over-IPv4 (proto-41) packets crossing the border firewall
should address this issue.

.SH SIGNALS
.BR "SIGHUP" " Force a reload of the daemon."

.BR "SIGINT" ", " "SIGTERM" " Shutdown the daemon."

.BR "SIGUSR1" ", " "SIGUSR2" " Do nothing, might be used in future "
versions.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @sysconfdir@/isatapd.conf
The default configuration file.

.TP
.I @localstatedir@/run/isatapd.pid
The process-id file.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
